In this project i try to automate mygovernment of India website.
In this project you will be able get updates of how much corona virus is spreading in India and day to day updates.
You will be able to take screenshot of that data.
You are able to get states and uts wise  data of corona virus in decreasing order.
You will be able to see the position of your states in that data.
If you have problem in english,don't worry it automatically  translate the whole data in hindi.
It will lead you to official instagram and tweeter page of my government of India where you see the latest posts and tweets of indian government.
It lead you to official youtube channel of my government of India and plays a video and stop that auomatically.
Meanwhile it generate a html file and you will see the output of that file in last tab.
